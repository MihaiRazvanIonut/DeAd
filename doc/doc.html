            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the Detention Admin Project is to build a web 
                application for managing visits for people that were convicted 
                and are part of a prison or a correctional house. This project
                also aims to manage the prisoners aswell as the information that
                can be gathered by monitoring these people closely in a manner
                that is friendly towards the user of the application.

            <h3>Document Conventions</h3>
            <p>
                The abbreviation API means application programmable interface, 
                which can be thought of as a contract of service between two
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                A REST API implies that the API is developed so that it follows
                the architectural constraints that the REST architecture suggests.

            <p>
                The Detention Admin Project aims to develop a simple to use tool
                for managing all kinds of information about prisoners and their
                visits. This information should be easy to access, manage and to
                be used for generating statistics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are major components in the Detention Admin Project:
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        Multi-Page Client: The component that the user sees and
                        interacts with. This component is built using HTML, CSS
                        and JS under a Python HTTP Server
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        REST APIs: services or micro services that will be used
                        by other
                        applications, or the frontend component to retrieve
                        information. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database: The component that stores information about
                        visits and prisoners. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These major components combined provide the full funtionality that
                the Detention Admin Project aims to supply to its users.

            <h3>Product Functions</h3>
            <p>
                This application aims to be an interactive and easy to use 
                graphic user interface system for managing a prison's database.
                That being said these are the core functions that the Detention
                Admin Project aims to provide to its users:
            <ul role="list">
                <li>
                    The user can see global updates on what they and their peers have
                    done throughout a given time span. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application will provide its users with the ability to
                    view, update or delete existing visits or to add a new visit
                    for a specific prisoner. This functionality will be also
                    present regarding information about prisoners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user will be able to generate and export statistics about
                    each individual prisoner or for all prisoners.
                </li>

                This application has in mind the following target audience:

                    <li>
                        Researchers and Data Analysts: This type of user could 
                        generate useful case studies on inmates and their life
                        in prison. These users will use the generating and 
                        exporting component of the application to do their work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Prison Warden and his subordinates: This type of user
                        is the main target audience of this application. These users
                        are expected to have minimal knowledge about computers.
                        This application should be easy enough to be understood
                        by this type of user and should provide its full functionality
                        without any higher level computer knowledge.

                The environment in which this application is meant to be
                operating is purely a web based environment for easier accessibility
                and cross-compatibility between devices being an application
                that was designed with a responsive user interface.

                        Security Constraints: being an application that manages
                        a prison's sensitive data, the Detention Admin Project
                        aims to handle its user information in a safe and 
                        protected manner conforming to the prison's legal 
                        policies storing and working only with data that is deemed
                        appropiate.

                    <li>
                        Interface Constraints: because this application aims to
                        be a user friendly way to interact with databases at its
                        core, it is constrained by this fact and should not 
                        implement hard to grasp concepts that its user might not
                        understand. These concepts once understood might be easier
                        to use but this application wants to keep its learning
                        curve in a liniar pattern.

                    <li>
                        Technologies and Tools Constraints: this application will
                        not use existing solutions for its services in the backend
                        component or powerfull tools on the frontend component
                        being constrained to vanilla HTML, CSS and JS by its
                        product owner. This application is also constrained to
                        build its services using a RESTful architecture.

                    <li>
                        Hardware Constraints: while this application aims to be
                        lightweight and fast, this target could be constrained 
                        by modern day browsers that could slow down and be taxing
                        on the users device.

            <p>
                This application can not be used by guest users or other types
                of users that are not part of the prison's staff. The only
                exception to this rule are researchers or data analysts that the
                prison has allowed to use a part of this application for case
                studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a given user is not logged in to this application he will not
                be able to use any of its functionality other than the login
                and register form.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the prison needs to add one of its staff members to the list
                of users that can use this application, the person in charge of
                this application will generate an invite code for this new user.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this behavior might seem to be against its users, this 
                application needs to be as secure and transparent as it can be.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the login process, a user will be greeted by the Global
                Updates page where the application shows the latest updates to
                the database, these updates contain information about the 
                user that has updated the database in any way indicating the time,
                the person who has done this action, the action type and the id of
                the updated piece of information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application also provides a way to see a user's own updates
                to the database as a way to keep track of his work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Visits page, a user can add a new visit to the database, 
                providing for this visit every single piece of important information.
                This page also provides a way to see all the visits that are stored
                in the database being able to search for a specific visit by using 
                the visit id, the date it was added or the purpose of the visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Prisoners page provides the same functionality as the 
                Visits page but for each individual prisoner. In this page
                a user can generate and export statistics suited to their
                needs.

                While this application is built without using existing solutions,

                This application assumes the fact that the smallest device that

                The color theme plays an important role in the day to day use of

                The methods in which this application displays its data or the way
                that it handles a new input into the database is meant to mimic
                how people used to handle such cases using tables and forms.
                This aproach should render this application to be easy to use by
                people that do not have high level skills using computers.

            </p>
            <p>
                The backend component of this application will be a solution completly
                buit from scratch using a HTTP Server that at the lowest level
                has a TCP Server and an inhouse dispatching system for request
                that will be the backbone of the entire application

            <p>
                The database that stores information about visits and prisoners
                and the database that handles user data are two software 
                interfaces should be engineered using known normalisation
                techniques.

            <p>
                The following are communications interfaces in the Detention Admin
                Project:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Communications through the web browser which mainly imply
                        the use of the user interface and the ability to access it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Communications through the RESTful APIs to 
                        access the information provided by the backend component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HTTPS protocol used for sending queries and receiveing
                        answers to these queries from the web server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JSONs as data transfer objects between the client and the
                        services
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The TCP protocol as the transport layer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The use of HTML forms to wrap and send desired information
                        so that the frontend can process it more easily into JSONs

                A user can add information about an upcoming visit to a prisoner
                using this feature. This feature allows the user to implement a 
                detailed log on what happened before, during and after a visit.
                This information should be as detailed as it can be so that when

                each individual prisoner in the following formats: HTML, CSV, JSON.
                These statistics should mirror exactly what happens in the prison
                and should indicate if there are any issues with the prisoners or the

                This application should conform to the prison's legal policies
                while also being careful with the data that it operates on.
                If a given visit is bound by any kind of confidentiality the data
                that is being collected by the user or the application should reflect
                this right and not log any data that is considered to be breaking
                this bound.
