            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the Detention Admin Project is to build a web 
                application for managing visits for people that were convicted 
                and are part of a prison or a correctional house. This project
                also aims to manage the prisoners aswell as the information that
                can be gathered by monitoring these people closely in a manner
                that is friendly towards the user of the application.

            <h3>Product Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                The Detention Admin Project aims to develop a simple to use tool
                for managing all kinds of information about prisoners and their
                visits. This information should be easy to access, manage and to
                be used for generating statistics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are major components in the Detention Admin Project:
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        Frontend: The component that the user sees and interacts
                        with. This component is built using HTML, CSS and JS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        API REST/GraphQL: A component that will be used by other
                        applications, or the frontend component to communicate
                        with the backend component. This application programming
                        interface will be implemented as a Rest or GraphQL API. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Backend: The component that manages requests, parses data,
                        builds statistics, manages the database, provides utility
                        for the API and Frontend component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database: The component that stores information about
                        visits and prisoners. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These major components combined provide the full funtionality that
                the Detention Admin Project aims to supply to its users.

        <section id="product-functions">
            <h3>Product Functions</h3>
            <p>
                This application aims to be an interactive and easy to use 
                graphic user interface system for managing a prison's database.
                That being said these are the core functions that the Detention
                Admin Project aims to provide to its users:
            <ul role="list">
                <li>
                    The user can see global updates on what they and their peers have
                    done throughout a given time span. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application will provide its users with the ability to
                    view, update or delete existing visits or to add a new visit
                    for a specific prisoner. This functionality will be also
                    present regarding information about prisoners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user will be able to generate and export statistics about
                    each individual prisoner.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <section id="user-classes">
            <h3>User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                This application has in mind the following target audience:
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        Researchers and Data Analysts: This type of user could 
                        generate useful case studies on inmates and their life
                        in prison. These users will use the generating and 
                        exporting component of the application to do their work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Prison Warden and his subordinates: This type of user
                        is the main target audience of this application. These users
                        are expected to have minimal knowledge about computers.
                        This application should be easy enough to be understood
                        by this type of user and should provide its full functionality
                        without any higher level computer knowledge.
                    </li>

            <h3>Operating Environment</h3>
            <p>
                The environment in which this application is meant to be
                operating is purely a web based environment for easier accessibility
                and cross-compatibility between devices being an application
                that was designed with a responsive user interface.

                        Security Constraints: being an application that manages
                        a prison's sensitive data, the Detention Admin Project
                        aims to handle its user information in a safe and 
                        protected manner conforming to the prison's legal 
                        policies storing and working only with data that is deemed
                        appropiate. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interface Constraints: because this application aims to
                        be a user friendly way to interact with databases at its
                        core, it is constrained by this fact and should not 
                        implement hard to grasp concepts that its user might not
                        understand. These concepts once understood might be easier
                        to use but this application wants to keep its learning
                        curve in a liniar pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Technologies and Tools Constraints: this application will
                        not use existing solutions for its servers in the backend
                        component or powerfull tools on the frontend component
                        being constrained to vanilla HTML, CSS and JS by its
                        product owner. This application is also constrained to
                        build its API using a Rest/GraphQL architecture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hardware Constraints: while this application aims to be
                        lightweight and fast, this target could be constrained 
                        by modern day browsers that could slow down and be taxing
                        on the users device.
